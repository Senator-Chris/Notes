    "The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of indeterminacy into quantum mechanics, for even if you know everything the theory has to tell you about the particle, still you cannot predict with certainty the outcome of a simple experiment to measure its position--all quantum mechanics has to offer is statistical information about the possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I do measure the position of the particle, and I find it to be at point C. Question: Where was the particle just before I made the measurement? There are three plausbile answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The <b>realist</b> position: The particle was at C. To the realist, indeterminacy is not a fact of nature, but a reflection of our ignorance. As d'Espagnat put it, \"the position of the particle was never indeterminate, but was merely unkonwn to the experimenter.\" Evidently $\\Psi$ is not the whole story--some additional information (known as a <b>hidden variable</b>) is needed to provide a complete description of the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The <b>orthodox</b> position: The particle wasn't really anywhere. It was the act of measurement that forced it to \"take a stand\" (though hwo and why it decided on the point C we dare not ask). Jordan said it most starkly: \"Observations not only disturb what is to be measured, they produce it. . . We compel [the particle] to assume a definite position.\" This view (the so called <u><b style=\"color:#156082\">Copenhagen interpretation</b></u>), is associated with Bohr and his followers. Among physicists it has always been the most widely accepted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The <b>agnostic</b> position: Refuse to answer. This is not quite as silly as it sounds--after all, what sense can there be in making assertions about the status of a particle before measurement, when the only of knowing whether you were right is precisly to make a measurement, in which case what you get is no longer \"before the measurement\"? It is metaphysics (in the pejorative sense of the word) to worry about something that cannot, by its nature, be tested. Pauli said: \"One should no more rack one's brain about the problem of whether something of how many angels are able to sit on the point of a needle.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1964, John Bell showed that it makes an observable difference whether the particle had a precise (though unknown) position prior to the measurement, or not. Bell's discovery effectively eliminated agnosticism as a viable option, and made it an experimental question where 1 or 2 is the correct choice. For now, suffice it to say that the experiments have decisively confirmed the orthodox interpretation: <b>a particle simply does not have a precise position prior to measurement; it is the measurement process that insists on one particular number, and thereby in a sense creates the specific result, limited only by the statistical weighting imposed by the wave function.</b>"

    "What if I made a second measurement, immediately after the first? Would I get C again? A repeated measurement (on the same particle) must return the same value. How does the orthodox interpretation account for the fact that the second measurement is bound to yield C? It must be that the first measurement radically alters the wave function, so that it is now sharply peaked about C. We say that the wave function <b>collapses</b>, upon measurement, to a spike about C.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, then, two entirely distinct kinds of physical processes: \"ordinary\" ones, in which the wave function evolves in a leisurely fashion under the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, and \"measurements,\" in which $\\Psi$ suddenly and discontinuously collapses."
